I still remember the first time we met—
 it was spring, 
 and the air smelled faintly of lavender.
You were standing under that
 old oak tree in the park,
 flipping through a book you never quite read,
 lost in thought.
I don’t think you noticed me at first.
But I noticed everything about you—
the way the sunlight caught your hair, 
the tiny wrinkle that formed when you smiled.
We didn’t fall in love all at once. 
It was slow,
like morning light creeping across the floor. 
You learned how I took my tea,
I learned how you hummed when you were nervous.
We built a life in small details,
 in shared silences, 
 in looks that said more than words ever could.
